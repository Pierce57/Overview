# Projects Overview

## Repositories (sorted by programming language)

### C++
* ECE 309 - Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming
  * Monopoly – Board Game Design / Development
    * Implemented a virtual Monopoly Board Game for up to 8 players using C++ in a team of four students. All rules and aspects of the game were simulated, and bot players were programmed to allow for solo play. My role was to design the overall software architecture of the program (data structures, classes, header files, etc.), as well as the Bank and Bot 
      Player classes. Additionally, I developed high level logic for other aspects of the program like main, conducted comprehensive debug/code review sessions of the entire program, and managed/performed program-wide documentation.

* ECE 506 - Architecture of Parallel Computers
  * Project 1: Scheduling in OpenMP Parallel Programming Model
    *  Parallelize a fundamental linear algebra algorithm using OpenMP, a parallel programming model based on the Shared Memory Model.
    *  Compare timing results between multiple datasets using different scheduling policies, chunk sizes, and processor counts. 
  * Project 2: Coherence Protocols
    * Create a 4-processor system simulator that implements and compares two different coherence protocol optimizations - Modified MSI and Dragon Protocol.
* ECE 563 - Microprocessor Architecture
* ECE 566 - Compiler Optimization and Scheduling
